# mpv-bookmarker
An mpv script to bookmark moments and cycle through them. 
Mostly intended for language learning.

## Key Bindings

- `b`: set a bookmark
- `B`: cycle loop through all the bookmarks starting from the first

### Misc

Since it's mostly intended for language learning, I would use this script to bookmark moments I want to look up the meaning of whatever was said and never pause during an episode, wait until the end to finally review all the bookmarks and mine if necessary.

I've added `delay`(default: 2),  `snap_to_subtitle`(default: true) and `display_osd`(default: false) options just in case.
