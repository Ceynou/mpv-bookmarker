# mpv-bookmarker
An mpv script to bookmark moments and cycle through them. 
Mostly intended for language learning.

## Key Bindings

- `b`: set a bookmark
- `B`: cycle loop through all the bookmarks starting from the first

### Misc

Since it's mostly intended for language learning, I would use this script to bookmark moments I want to look up the meaning of whatever was said and never pause during an episode, wait until the end to finally review all the bookmarks and mine if necessary.
